## The Problem

Large codebases are hard to understand. Traditional tools show you:
- **File trees** — not architecture
- **Grep results** — not relationships
- **2D diagrams** — cluttered, overlapping, unusable at scale
- **Static documentation** — outdated the moment it's written

Meanwhile, the real questions developers ask are graph questions:
- "What depends on this class?"
- "Where does this data flow?"
- "What breaks if I remove this?"
- "How does user input reach the database?"

## 3D Visualisation

Traditional dependency diagrams become unreadable at scale. Lines cross, nodes overlap, and you end up with a tangled mess that hides more than it reveals.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="2D Diagrams" icon="diagram-project">
    - Lines crossing everywhere
    - Nodes overlap and obscure each other
    - Can't see depth or clustering
    - Zoom in = lose context, zoom out = see nothing
  </Card>
  <Card title="3D Space" icon="cube">
    - Use depth to separate clusters
    - Navigate through your architecture
    - Rotate to see hidden connections
    - Natural spatial grouping by dependencies
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

In 3D space, your codebase becomes a **place you can explore**. Related components cluster together naturally through force-directed layout. You can fly through your architecture, zoom into areas of interest, and see the whole structure at once.

## Plugin System

CodeGraph is designed for extensibility. Anyone can write plugins that add data layers to the visualization.

| Plugin Type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **Overlay plugins** | Git activity, test coverage, complexity metrics, code ownership |
| **Analyzer plugins** | Support for additional languages |
| **Export plugins** | Output to different formats (JSON, GraphML, DOT) |

Plugins use the same interfaces as built-in components—community plugins are first-class citizens.

## Attribute Philosophy

Inspired by **SideFX Houdini**, CodeGraph treats everything as attributes on nodes. There's no rigid schema—just nodes with dynamic key-value pairs:

```json
{
  "id": "MyApp.UserService",
  "name": "UserService",
  "type": "Class",
  "git:churn": 45,
  "coverage:percent": 85.5,
  "complexity:cyclomatic": 12
}
```

Each plugin writes to its own namespace (`git:`, `coverage:`, `complexity:`). This enables flexible, conflict-free extensibility.

## Dataflow and Taint Analysis

CodeGraph enables **security-focused queries** that trace data through your codebase:

| Query | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Source → Sink paths | Find how user input reaches databases |
| Shortest path | Understand coupling between modules |
| All dependents | Impact analysis before refactoring |
| Circular dependencies | Find architectural violations |

This transforms security analysis from "grep and hope" to **structural queries with guaranteed coverage**.

## Why Not Alternatives?

| Tool | Analysis | 3D Visualization | Community Plugins | Graph Queries |
|------|----------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **CodeScene** | Yes | No | No | No |
| **NDepend** | Yes | No | No | Limited |
| **SonarQube** | Yes | No | Limited | No |
| **Understand** | Yes | No | No | No |
| **CodeGraph** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

CodeGraph is the only tool that combines:
1. **Graph database backend** for powerful queries
2. **3D interactive visualization** for spatial exploration
3. **Community plugin system** for extensibility
4. **Attribute-based architecture** for flexibility
