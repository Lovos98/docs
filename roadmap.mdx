# Roadmap

CodeGraph is actively evolving. Here's what we're working on and where we need community help.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Dataflow Analysis" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left">
    Track how data flows through your code. See field reads/writes and identify taint sources for security analysis.
  </Card>
  <Card title="LLM / RAG Integration" icon="robot">
    Ask questions about your architecture in natural language. "What depends on this?" "What breaks if I remove this?"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Language Support" icon="code">
    TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, and more via tree-sitter parsers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Snapshot Compare" icon="code-compare">
    Ghost previews comparing old and new repository states. See what changed between commits, branches, or releases.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Git Integration" icon="code-branch">
    Direct git integration for branch analysis, commit history, and blame data without external tools.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Live File Watcher" icon="eye">
    Auto-analyze when files change. Keep your graph in sync with your codebase in real-time.

## AI-Powered Code Understanding (RAG)

The graph database enables something 2D tools can't do: **give an LLM actual understanding of your architecture**.

Connect an LLM to your codebase graph and ask questions like:
- "What classes handle user authentication?"
- "Show me the data flow from API to database"
- "What would break if I remove this service?"
- "Find all paths where user input reaches SQL queries"

Traditional RAG uses flat file search—it finds text but doesn't understand relationships. CodeGraph's graph structure provides:

| Approach | What It Knows |
|----------|--------------|
| File search | "This file mentions UserService" |
| CodeGraph RAG | "UserService is called by AuthController, depends on IUserRepository, and is instantiated in DependencyConfig" |

The graph gives the LLM **context about relationships**, not just text matches.

## Planned Edge Types

These relationships are defined but not yet implemented:

| Edge | Category | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `Reads` | DataFlow | Method reads a field/property |
| `Writes` | DataFlow | Method writes a field/property |
| `Returns` | DataFlow | Method returns a type |
| `Creates` | DataFlow | Method instantiates a type |
| `Throws` | DataFlow | Method can throw exception |
| `DataFlowsTo` | DataFlow | Data flows from variable A to B |

See the [Analyzer](/concepts/analyzer) page for currently implemented edges.

## Growing Together

CodeGraph solves a real problem: understanding large codebases is hard. But we can't build every feature ourselves. We need help with:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Language Plugins" icon="code">
    Tree-sitter parsers for TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, Rust
  </Card>
  <Card title="Overlay Plugins" icon="layer-group">
    SonarQube metrics, code ownership, custom business rules
  </Card>
  <Card title="Export Plugins" icon="file-export">
    Confluence, Notion, custom dashboards
  </Card>
  <Card title="Visualization Experiments" icon="cube">
    VR mode, AR overlays, different layout algorithms
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The GPL-3.0 license ensures that as CodeGraph grows, **everyone benefits**. Improvements flow back to the community, and no single company can lock away the best features.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all sizes:

1. **Use it** and report issues
2. **Write plugins** for your use case
3. **Improve docs** when something is unclear
4. **Add language support** through analyzer plugins
5. **Fix bugs** and submit PRs

See our [Contributing Guide](/contributing/overview) to get started.
