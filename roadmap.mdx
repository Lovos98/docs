CodeGraph is actively evolving. Here's what we're working on and where we need community help.

## Planned Edge Types

These dataflow relationships are defined but not yet implemented:

| Category | Edge | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| <span style={{color: '#f59e0b'}}>DataFlow</span> | `Reads` | Method reads a field/property |
| <span style={{color: '#f59e0b'}}>DataFlow</span> | `Writes` | Method writes a field/property |
| <span style={{color: '#f59e0b'}}>DataFlow</span> | `Returns` | Method returns a type |
| <span style={{color: '#f59e0b'}}>DataFlow</span> | `Creates` | Method instantiates a type |
| <span style={{color: '#f59e0b'}}>DataFlow</span> | `Throws` | Method can throw exception |
| <span style={{color: '#f59e0b'}}>DataFlow</span> | `DataFlowsTo` | Data flows from variable A to B |

See the [Analyzer](/contributing/analyzer) page for currently implemented edges.

## Growing Together

CodeGraph solves a real problem: understanding large codebases is hard. But we can't build every feature ourselves. We need help with:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Language Plugins" icon="code">
    Tree-sitter parsers for TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, Rust
  </Card>
  <Card title="Overlay Plugins" icon="layer-group">
    SonarQube metrics, code ownership, custom business rules
  </Card>
  <Card title="Export Plugins" icon="file-export">
    Confluence, Notion, custom dashboards
  </Card>
  <Card title="Visualization Experiments" icon="cube">
    VR mode, AR overlays, different layout algorithms
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The GPL-3.0 license ensures that as CodeGraph grows, **everyone benefits**. Improvements flow back to the community, and no single company can lock away the best features.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all sizes:

1. **Use it** and report issues
2. **Write plugins** for your use case
3. **Improve docs** when something is unclear
4. **Add language support** through analyzer plugins
5. **Fix bugs** and submit PRs

See our [Contributing Guide](/contributing/overview) to get started.
