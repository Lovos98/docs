title: Explore the 3D Graph
description: "Navigate and interact with your code visualization"
---

Once you've analyzed a codebase, it's time to explore it visually. This tutorial covers all the navigation and interaction features.

## Starting the Visualization

Make sure both servers are running:

```bash
# Terminal 1: API Server
npx @dotenvx/dotenvx run -- dotnet run --project src/adapters/driving/api

# Terminal 2: Web Frontend
cd src/adapters/driving/web && pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## Interface Overview

The interface consists of four main areas:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/tutorials/full-interface.png" alt="CodeGraph Interface Overview" />
</Frame>

| Area | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **3D Graph** | Center | Interactive code visualization |
| **Main Toolbar** | Top | View controls, layout, settings |
| **Selection Toolbar** | Top (appears on selection) | Selection mode controls |
| **Left Sidebar** | Left | Search, filters, layers |
| **Right Sidebar** | Right | Node details, connections |

## Main Toolbar

The main toolbar provides global controls for the visualization.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/tutorials/main-toolbar.png" alt="Main Toolbar" />
</Frame>

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Restart Layout** | Recalculate node positions from scratch |
| **Undo/Redo** | Step through selection history |
| **Zoom In/Out** | Adjust view zoom level |
| **Labels** | Toggle class/member labels, adjust size |
| **Brightness** | Adjust overall graph brightness |
| **GPU Tweaks** | Fine-tune layout algorithm parameters |
| **Sidebar Toggles** | Show/hide left and right panels |

## Selection Toolbar

When you select nodes, the selection toolbar appears with mode controls.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/tutorials/selection-toolbar.png" alt="Selection Toolbar" />
</Frame>

### Selection Modes (Q W E R)

Use the **Q, W, E, R** keys for quick access to selection modes—they're right next to each other for easy finger access:

| Key | Mode | Icon | Description |
|-----|------|------|-------------|
| **Q** | New | Pointer | Click replaces current selection |
| **W** | Add | Plus | Click adds to current selection |
| **E** | Subtract | Minus | Click removes from selection |
| **R** | Intersect | Merge | Keep only nodes in both selections |

<Tip>
The Q-W-E-R layout means you can switch modes without moving your hand—they're all under your left fingers on a QWERTY keyboard.
</Tip>

### Selection Depth

Control how many hops from your selection to include:

- **Depth 1**: Only directly connected nodes
- **Depth 2**: Nodes within 2 hops
- **Depth 3-5**: Wider neighborhood

Use the **+** and **-** buttons to adjust depth.

### Other Selection Controls

| Control | Shortcut | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Undo** | `Ctrl+Z` | Undo last selection change |
| **Redo** | `Ctrl+Shift+Z` | Redo selection change |
| **Clear** | `Esc` | Deselect all nodes |

## Left Sidebar

The left sidebar contains search and filtering tools.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/tutorials/left-sidebar.png" alt="Left Sidebar" />
</Frame>

### Search

Find nodes by name or filter by properties:

```
UserService          # Find by name
type:Interface       # Filter by type
namespace:MyApp.Core # Filter by namespace
```

Search results highlight matching nodes in the graph.

### Filters

Toggle visibility of node types:

| Filter | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Namespaces** | Show/hide namespace containers |
| **Classes** | Show/hide class nodes |
| **Methods** | Show/hide method-level detail |
| **Tests** | Show/hide test classes |

### Layers Panel

Switch between different views:

- **Structure**: Default dependency view
- **Inheritance**: Focus on class hierarchy
- **Call Graph**: Method-level call relationships

## Right Sidebar

The right sidebar shows details about selected nodes.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/tutorials/right-sidebar.png" alt="Right Sidebar" />
</Frame>

### Node Information

When you click a node, the sidebar shows:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | Class/interface/method name |
| **Type** | Node type (Class, Interface, etc.) |
| **File** | Source file path (clickable to open) |
| **Namespace** | Containing namespace |
| **Lines** | Line count |

### Connections

View incoming and outgoing relationships:

- **Dependencies**: What this node depends on
- **Dependents**: What depends on this node
- **Inheritance**: Parent classes/interfaces
- **Implementations**: Implementing classes

Click any connection to navigate to that node.

### Attributes

View all attributes on the node, including overlay data:

```
coverage:percent = 85.5
git:churn = 12
complexity:cyclomatic = 8
```

## Navigation Controls

### Mouse Controls

| Action | Control |
|--------|---------|
| **Rotate** | Left click + drag |
| **Pan** | Right click + drag |
| **Zoom** | Scroll wheel |
| **Select node** | Left click on node |
| **Focus node** | Double-click on node |
| **Deselect** | Click on empty space |

### Keyboard Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Q` | New selection mode |
| `W` | Add to selection mode |
| `E` | Subtract from selection mode |
| `R` | Intersect selection mode |
| `Escape` | Clear selection |
| `Ctrl+Z` | Undo selection |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Z` | Redo selection |

### Touch Controls (Mobile/Tablet)

| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| One finger drag | Rotate |
| Two finger drag | Pan |
| Pinch | Zoom |
| Tap | Select node |
| Double tap | Focus node |

## Understanding the View

### Node Types

Nodes are colored by type:

| Type | Color | Shape |
|------|-------|-------|
| Namespace | Blue | Large sphere |
| Class | Green | Medium sphere |
| Interface | Yellow | Medium sphere |
| Struct | Orange | Medium sphere |
| Enum | Purple | Small sphere |
| Method | Gray | Small sphere |

### Edge Types

Edges represent relationships:

| Type | Style |
|------|-------|
| `CONTAINS` | Thin gray line |
| `DEPENDS_ON` | White line |
| `INHERITS` | Thick blue line |
| `IMPLEMENTS` | Dashed yellow line |
| `CALLS` | Thin line (method-level only) |

## Graph Layout

### Automatic Layout

The graph uses ForceAtlas2 layout algorithm. Nodes naturally cluster based on their connections—highly connected components group together.

### Manual Positioning

Drag nodes to new positions:
1. Click and hold on a node
2. Drag to desired position
3. Release to drop

<Tip>
Your manual positions are saved. Use the "Restart Layout" button to recalculate from scratch.
</Tip>

### GPU-Accelerated Layout

For large graphs (1000+ nodes), use GPU layout:

1. Click the GPU Tweaks button in toolbar
2. Adjust parameters if needed
3. Click "Compute Layout"
4. Wait for GPU computation (progress shown)

GPU layout is significantly faster for large graphs.

## Performance Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Graph is slow/laggy">
    - Reduce visible nodes with filters
    - Hide method-level nodes
    - Use isolation mode (select + filter to neighborhood)
    - Enable GPU layout for initial positioning
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too many edges">
    - Filter by edge type
    - Show only strong connections
    - Use the layers panel to switch views
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't find a node">
    - Use search with exact name
    - Check filters aren't hiding it
    - Try `type:Class` or `type:Interface` filters
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
