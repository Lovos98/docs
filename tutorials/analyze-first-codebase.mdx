# Analyze Your First Codebase

This tutorial walks you through analyzing a real .NET codebase with CodeGraph.

<Note>
For details on what nodes and edges CodeGraph extracts, see the [Analyzer](/concepts/analyzer) page.
</Note>

## Step 1: Choose a Codebase

For this tutorial, we'll use a sample project. You can substitute your own `.sln` file.

```bash
# Clone a sample project
git clone https://github.com/dotnet/samples.git
cd samples/core/console-apps
```

Or use any .NET solution you have locally.

## Step 2: Run the Analysis

```bash
npx @dotenvx/dotenvx run -- sh -c 'dotnet run --project src/adapters/driving/cli -- analyze /path/to/YourSolution.sln'
```

### Understanding the Output

```
Analyzing /path/to/YourSolution.sln...

[1/4] Loading solution...
  Found 5 projects:
  - MyApp.Core
  - MyApp.Infrastructure
  - MyApp.Web
  - MyApp.Tests
  - MyApp.IntegrationTests

  Writing edges... done

Analysis complete!
  Duration: 6.3s
  Nodes: 1,105
  Edges: 2,453
```

## Step 3: Verify in Neo4j

Open Neo4j Browser at `http://localhost:7474` and run:

```cypher
// Count all nodes
MATCH (n:CodeNode) RETURN count(n) as nodes

// See node types
MATCH (n:CodeNode) RETURN n.type, count(*) ORDER BY count(*) DESC

// View a sample class
MATCH (n:CodeNode {type: 'Class'}) RETURN n LIMIT 5
```

## Step 4: Explore Node Attributes

Each node has attributes that you can query:

```cypher
MATCH (n:CodeNode {name: 'UserService'})
RETURN n.name, n.type, n.filePath, n.namespace
```

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `name` | Entity name |
| `type` | Node type (Class, Interface, etc.) |
| `fullName` | Fully qualified name |
| `filePath` | Source file path |
| `namespace` | Containing namespace |
| `visibility` | Public, Private, Internal |
| `isAbstract` | Whether class is abstract |
| `isStatic` | Whether class is static |

## Analysis Options

### Verbose Mode

See detailed progress:

```bash
codegraph analyze ./Solution.sln --verbose
```

### Filter by Project

Analyze only specific projects:

```bash
codegraph analyze ./Solution.sln --include "*.Core" --include "*.Domain"
```

### Exclude Test Projects

```bash
codegraph analyze ./Solution.sln --exclude "*Tests*"
```

### Method-Level Analysis

By default, CodeGraph analyzes at class level. For method-level:

```bash
codegraph analyze ./Solution.sln --depth methods
```

<Warning>
Method-level analysis can produce very large graphs. Start with class-level for large codebases.
</Warning>

## Incremental Analysis

For large codebases, you can analyze incrementally:

```bash
# First full analysis
codegraph analyze ./Solution.sln

# Later, only changed files
codegraph analyze ./Solution.sln --incremental
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Analysis fails with 'Could not load project'">
    Make sure you can build the solution normally:
    ```bash
    dotnet restore ./Solution.sln
    dotnet build ./Solution.sln
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Very slow analysis">
    - Exclude test projects with `--exclude "*Tests*"`
    - Use class-level analysis instead of method-level
    - Check Neo4j memory settings
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing dependencies">
    Some dependencies might not be detected if they're:
    - Dynamic (reflection-based)
    - In third-party assemblies
    - Loaded at runtime
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
