description: "Visualize your codebase as an interactive 3D graph"
---

CodeGraph transforms your codebase into an interactive 3D graph. See your architecture, explore dependencies, and understand structure that's invisible in traditional code navigation.

## Three Layers

CodeGraph is built on three layers—each does one job:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Parse your source code and understand its structure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extract" icon="diagram-project">
    Pull out classes, methods, dependencies, inheritance, and call relationships into a graph database
  </Step>
  <Step title="Visualize" icon="cube">
    Render the graph as an interactive 3D space you can explore
  </Step>
</Steps>

That's it. Code goes in, explorable architecture comes out.
