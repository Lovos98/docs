# CodeGraph

CodeGraph transforms your codebase into an interactive 3D graph. See your architecture, explore dependencies, and understand structure that's invisible in traditional code navigation.

## Three Layers

CodeGraph is built on three layers—each does one job:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Parse your source code and understand its structure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extract" icon="diagram-project">
    Pull out classes, methods, dependencies, inheritance, and call relationships into a graph database
  </Step>
  <Step title="Visualize" icon="cube">
    Render the graph as an interactive 3D space you can explore
  </Step>
</Steps>

That's it. Code goes in, explorable architecture comes out.

## Key Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="3D Exploration" icon="cube">
    Navigate your codebase spatially. Zoom, rotate, click through your architecture.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Graph Queries" icon="database">
    Ask questions: "What depends on this?" "Shortest path between modules?" "What breaks if I remove this?"
  </Card>
  <Card title="GPU Layout" icon="microchip">
    Fast force-directed layout for graphs with thousands of nodes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Plugin System" icon="plug">
    Add overlays for git activity, test coverage, complexity, and custom metrics.
  </Card>

## Quick Start

```bash
# Analyze a .NET solution
codegraph analyze ./MyProject.sln

# Start the visualization
codegraph serve

# Open http://localhost:5173
```

## Roadmap

We're actively developing new capabilities:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Dataflow Analysis" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left">
    Track how data flows through your code. See field reads/writes and identify taint sources.
  </Card>
  <Card title="LLM / RAG Integration" icon="robot">
    Ask questions about your architecture in natural language. "What depends on this?" "What breaks if I remove this?"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Language Support" icon="code">
    TypeScript, Python, Java, and more via tree-sitter parsers.
  </Card>
