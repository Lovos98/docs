CodeGraph transforms your codebase into an interactive 3D graph. See your architecture, explore dependencies, and understand structure that's invisible in traditional code navigation.

## The Problem

Large codebases are hard to understand. Traditional tools show you:
- **File trees** — not architecture
- **Grep results** — not relationships
- **2D diagrams** — cluttered, overlapping, unusable at scale
- **Static documentation** — outdated the moment it's written

Meanwhile, the real questions developers ask are graph questions:
- "What depends on this class?"
- "Where does this data flow?"
- "What breaks if I remove this?"
- "How does user input reach the database?"

## Three Layers

CodeGraph is built on three layers—each does one job:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Parse your source code and understand its structure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extract" icon="diagram-project">
    Pull out classes, methods, dependencies, inheritance, and call relationships into a graph database
  </Step>
  <Step title="Visualize" icon="cube">
    Render the graph as an interactive 3D space you can explore
  </Step>
</Steps>

That's it. Code goes in, explorable architecture comes out.

## 3D Visualisation

Traditional dependency diagrams become unreadable at scale. Lines cross, nodes overlap, and you end up with a tangled mess that hides more than it reveals.

  <Card title="2D Diagrams" icon="diagram-project">
    - Lines crossing everywhere
    - Nodes overlap and obscure each other
    - Can't see depth or clustering
    - Zoom in = lose context, zoom out = see nothing
  </Card>
  <Card title="3D Space" icon="cube">
    - Use depth to separate clusters
    - Navigate through your architecture
    - Rotate to see hidden connections
    - Natural spatial grouping by dependencies
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

In 3D space, your codebase becomes a **place you can explore**. Related components cluster together naturally through force-directed layout. You can fly through your architecture, zoom into areas of interest, and see the whole structure at once.
