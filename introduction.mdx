## The Problem

Codebases are growing faster than ever with AI.

The race to ship quickly with AI often leads to sprawling complexity—code multiplying faster than teams can understand or control it.

Without improved tooling and better safeguards, it can make codebases exponentially harder to reason about and maintain for both humans and agents, ultimately slowing you down.

**This is where CodeGraph comes in.**

CodeGraph transforms your codebase into an interactive 3D graph. See your architecture, explore dependencies, and understand structure that's invisible in traditional code navigation.

## How It Works

CodeGraph is built on three layers—each does one job:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze" icon="magnifying-glass" iconColor="#6366F1">
    Parse your source code and understand its structure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extract" icon="diagram-project" iconColor="#6366F1">
    Pull out classes, methods, dependencies, inheritance, and call relationships into a graph database
  </Step>
  <Step title="Visualize" icon="cube" iconColor="#6366F1">
    Render the graph as an interactive 3D space you can explore
  </Step>
</Steps>

Code goes in, explorable architecture comes out.

## 3D Visualization

Traditional dependency diagrams become unreadable at scale. Lines cross, nodes overlap, and you end up with a tangled mess that hides more than it reveals.

  <Card title="Traditional Tools" icon="diagram-project">
    - **File trees** — not architecture
    - **Grep results** — not relationships
    - **2D diagrams** — cluttered, unusable at scale
    - **Static docs** — outdated the moment they're written
  </Card>
  <Card title="CodeGraph" icon="cube">
    - Use depth to separate clusters
    - Navigate through your architecture
    - Rotate to see hidden connections
    - Natural spatial grouping by dependencies
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

In 3D space, your codebase becomes a **place you can explore**. Related components cluster together naturally through force-directed layout. Fly through your architecture, zoom into areas of interest, and see the whole structure at once.
