## The Problem

The race to ship quickly often leads to sprawling complexity. Code multiplies faster than teams can understand or control it. Large legacy systems become black boxes that only a few developers dare to touch.

Without improved tooling and better visibility, codebases become exponentially harder to reason about and maintain—for both humans and AI agents—ultimately slowing you down.

**This is where CodeGraph comes in.**

CodeGraph transforms your codebase into an interactive 3D graph. See your architecture, explore dependencies, and understand structure that's invisible in traditional code navigation.

## Key Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="3D Exploration" icon="cube">
    Navigate your codebase spatially. Zoom, rotate, fly through your architecture.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Depth Controls" icon="sliders">
    Select nodes and expand connections by depth. See 1, 2, or N levels of dependencies.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Impact Analysis" icon="bolt">
    See what breaks before you merge. Query all dependents of changed code.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Plugin System" icon="plug">
    Add overlays for git activity, test coverage, complexity, and custom metrics.

  <Card title="Faster Onboarding" icon="graduation-cap">
    New developers explore visually. Reduce ramp-up time from months to weeks.

## How It Works

CodeGraph is built on three layers—each does one job:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze" icon="magnifying-glass" iconColor="#6366F1">
    Parse your source code and understand its structure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extract" icon="diagram-project" iconColor="#6366F1">
    Pull out classes, methods, dependencies, inheritance, and call relationships into a graph database
  </Step>
  <Step title="Visualize" icon="cube" iconColor="#6366F1">
    Render the graph as an interactive 3D space you can explore
  </Step>
</Steps>

Code goes in, explorable architecture comes out.

## Traditional vs CodeGraph

| Aspect | Traditional Tools | CodeGraph |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Structure** | File trees | Semantic model (classes, dependencies, relationships) |
| **Visualization** | 2D diagrams that break at scale | 3D space with depth-controlled exploration |
| **Search** | Grep results (text matches) | Graph queries (structural relationships) |
| **Documentation** | Static docs (outdated instantly) | Live visualization (always current) |
| **Connections** | Lines crossing everywhere | Rotate and navigate to see true relationships |
| **Scale** | Unusable beyond ~50 nodes | Handles thousands of nodes with GPU layout |

In 3D space, your codebase becomes a **place you can explore**. Related components cluster together naturally through force-directed layout. Fly through your architecture, zoom into areas of interest, and see the whole structure at once.
