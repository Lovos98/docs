## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive experience. Please:

- Be respectful and considerate
- Welcome newcomers and help them learn
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Assume good intentions

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally
3. **Set up the development environment** (see [Development Setup](/contributing/development-setup))
4. **Create a branch** for your changes
5. **Make your changes** with tests
6. **Submit a pull request**

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Code follows the existing style
- [ ] Tests pass locally (`dotnet test`)
- [ ] New features include tests
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Commit messages are clear

### PR Guidelines

1. **Keep PRs focused** - One feature or fix per PR
2. **Write clear descriptions** - Explain what and why
3. **Reference issues** - Link related issues
4. **Be patient** - Reviews may take time

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:

```
feat: add git activity overlay
fix: resolve layout crash on empty graphs
docs: improve GPU setup instructions
test: add coverage for overlay removal
refactor: simplify graph storage interface
```

## Development Guidelines

### Architecture

CodeGraph follows hexagonal architecture. Before contributing:

1. Read the [Architecture documentation](/concepts/architecture)
2. Understand the separation of core and adapters
3. Keep domain logic in `core/`, external interactions in `adapters/`

### Code Style

- Follow existing code style
- Use meaningful names
- Add XML documentation for public APIs
- Keep methods focused and small

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Maintain or improve coverage
- Test edge cases
- Use mocks for external dependencies

```csharp
[Test]
public async Task NewFeature_ShouldDoExpectedThing()
{
    // Arrange
    var mockStorage = new Mock<IGraphStorage>();

    // Act
    var result = await subject.DoThing();

    // Assert
    Assert.That(result, Is.EqualTo(expected));
}
```
