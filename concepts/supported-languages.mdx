CodeGraph currently supports **C#** with plans to expand to other languages.

## C# (.NET)

<Card title="C# / .NET" icon="microsoft">
  **Status**: Full support

  **Parser**: Roslyn (Microsoft's official C# compiler platform)

  **File types**: `.cs`, `.csproj`, `.sln`
</Card>

CodeGraph uses **Roslyn**, Microsoft's official compiler platform. This provides semantic analysis—understanding types, not just syntax—with full dependency resolution across your entire solution.

See the [Analyzer](/concepts/analyzer) page for detailed information about what gets extracted.

## Future Languages

We're planning support for additional languages via [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/), which supports **100+ programming languages**.

### High Priority

Languages we're actively planning to support:

| Language | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| TypeScript / JavaScript | Web applications, Node.js backends |
| Python | Data science, ML pipelines, scripting |
| Java | Enterprise applications |
| Go | Cloud infrastructure, microservices |
| Rust | Systems programming, performance-critical code |

### Also Possible

Tree-sitter has parsers for many more languages:

- **Systems**: C, C++, Zig, Nim
- **JVM**: Kotlin, Scala, Groovy
- **Functional**: Haskell, OCaml, Elixir, F#
- **Scripting**: Ruby, PHP, Perl, Lua
- **Scientific**: MATLAB, R, Julia
- **Mobile**: Swift, Objective-C
- **Query**: SQL, GraphQL

### What Works Best

CodeGraph works with any language that has clear structural elements—classes, functions, modules, imports. This includes:

- Object-oriented languages (Java, C#, Python)
- Functional languages (Haskell, OCaml, F#)
- Multi-paradigm languages (Rust, Go, Kotlin)
- Procedural languages (C, Lua)

<Note>
Tree-sitter provides **syntactic** analysis. Semantic accuracy may be lower than Roslyn for C#. Type inference and cross-file resolution depend on the language plugin implementation.
