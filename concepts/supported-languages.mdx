# Supported Languages

CodeGraph currently supports **C#** with plans to expand to other languages.

## C# (.NET)

<Card title="C# / .NET" icon="microsoft">
  **Status**: Full support

  **Parser**: Roslyn (Microsoft's official C# compiler platform)

  **File types**: `.cs`, `.csproj`, `.sln`
</Card>

CodeGraph uses **Roslyn**, Microsoft's official compiler platform. This provides semantic analysis—understanding types, not just syntax—with full dependency resolution across your entire solution.

### What Gets Extracted

See the [Analyzer](/concepts/analyzer) page for detailed information about node types and relationship types.

**Nodes** (code entities):
- Namespaces, Classes, Interfaces, Structs, Enums, Records
- Methods, Constructors, Properties, Fields, Events

**Edges** (relationships):
- Structural: Contains, Inherits, Implements, Overrides
- Coupling: Calls, Instantiates, References

## Future Languages

We're planning support for additional languages via [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/):

- TypeScript / JavaScript
- Python
- Java
- Go
- Rust

<Note>
Tree-sitter provides **syntactic** analysis. Semantic accuracy may be lower than Roslyn for C#.
